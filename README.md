# Silt-Load-Determination
Determining silt load in water bodies is essential for human intervention and
the improvement of water quality. Human activities such as construction, agriculture, 
and deforestation significantly contribute to the silt load in rivers, lakes,
and reservoirs
Capacitive sensing is emerging as a powerful method for determining silt load
in water bodies. This innovative approach leverages the principles of capacitance,
where the presence of silt particles in water alters the dielectric properties of the
medium. By measuring changes in capacitance, we can accurately quantify the
concentration of silt in the water.
